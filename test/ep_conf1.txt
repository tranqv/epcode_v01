# we can write comments starting with "#" or  
! with "!", as in this sentence. 
# Just put these keywords at the left-most position of wer comment.
# For examples:
# this is a comment
   # this is also a comment
   ! and so be this 

#  We should define the value of the variable on the right side of the '='. 
#  If we intend to define it in subsequent lines, leave the right side of 
#  the '=' empty. Otherwise, the program may not work properly.
#  For example:
#  1. nome = 12   OK     
#  2. nome = 
#     12          OK     
#  3. nome = !    error


nome = 10 
npar = 10 
g = 0.4
neiv = 2 
tole = 0
prefix = test_Ex01

#  Pre-processing only:
#  prep = True
